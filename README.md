# Virtual Farm

This project describes my journey, into creating a Virtual Farm simulator.

* What is Virtual Farm *
A 3D version of a farm with a one or more crops. This we should be able to see in computer screen, or navigate it using VR Device (like Oculus), or even put a virtual camera, and train a AI agent to navigate it.

We should be able to generate any crop, in any conditions. they will be like age, weather, yield, sunlight, pests and so on. 

* Why we need it *
In future robots should be able to grow our crops. It might be in land based farms or virtical farms. It takes lot of time for us to shitch to alternatives like cell-factories. So these robots need to know how to navigate our existing farms and they need to know how to take care of stuff.

In order to do that, AI needs a virtual environment to train these things. Doing things only with physical objects, takes lot of effort and cost. And more than that it is time consuming. Future is digital first, our entire world will be reconstructed in 3D very soon.

## Journey

### Day 1

We need to understand what are game engines, what are 3d assets, how to render them.
